This is a jQuery API browser 
-build entirely from jQuery raw API dump in XML format.
-XSLT transformation is done to show APIs in a presentable html format.
-javascript is used to do some searching menu functions and preview demo, edit demo options.
-One can run the existing demo supplied by jquery along with their API. But there is option to edit the demo code and run
locally in an iframe.
-This viewer is better than API browser provided by jQuery in terms of loading time. Because it gets locaded only once.
-Another advantage is that, this will show snapshot of the APIs based on some tags in menu. 
-In addition to these since the whole XML is loaded at once, one can simple use some text searching tool of browser to
find the requied item.


Please let me know if anyone wants more features.  

This XML can be seen with stylesheet just by pointing the browser to xml.
